A couple of my personal projects while learning python. In the "Week 1" file I created a birthday calculator, where it takes the users birthday, and calculates
how old they are. In the "Week 2" folder, I tried to utilize OOP and create a shuffled deck of cards. 

I meant to have two different respoitories for these but didn't fully understand how git works
